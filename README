This package assumes the following configuration:

1. Packages "rrdtool" and "sysstat" are installed.
2. User "stats" exists with the following paths:
      /home/stats/bin/rrdstatsr	- contains all executables.
	  /home/stats/data			- contains all round-robin databases.
	  /home/stats/stats			- generated graphs are placed in this directory.

Four types of executables are provided:

1. "rrdcreate-..." are used to create the round-robin databases. You must modify the "rrdcreate-disk" 
	and "rrdcreate-net" to match your hardware configuration, and you may need to issue each of these
	commands more than once; i.e one database for each disk, each interface, etc.
2. "rrdupdate-..." are used to gather statistics from /proc. see "crontab.sample".
3. "rrdgraph-..." are used to generate graphs.
4. Misceleneous commands, eg. the "eg" will generate any of the canned graphs and display the result 
	using gthumb.
